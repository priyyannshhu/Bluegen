## Overview ðŸŒŸ

**BlueGen: Your AI-Powered Bhagavad Gita Companion**

BlueGen is an intuitive platform that brings the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita to life using artificial intelligence. At its core is a chatbot powered by GitaGPT, which provides solutions to a wide range of issues by referencing the teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Unlike other AI tools, such as ChatGPT, that offer modern solutions to life's challenges, our GitaGPT specifically draws from the timeless wisdom of the Gita to guide users through their personal struggles.

In addition to the chatbot, BlueGen features a Book Section for reading the complete Bhagavad Gita and a Quotes Section filled with inspiring teachings to uplift your spirit. The platform is designed to make the Gitaâ€™s wisdom easily accessible, complete with customizable themes and real-time chat capabilities.

Built using ReactJS and styled with CSS, BlueGen ensures a seamless user experience, deployed on Vercel for fast and reliable access. With integrated social media links, it fosters a community dedicated to spiritual growth and inner peace.

BlueGen effectively combines the ancient knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita with contemporary technology, serving as a personal tool for self-reflection and spiritual exploration.
