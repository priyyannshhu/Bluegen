          <h1>Gita Ch 01 - Arjuna Vishada Yoga</h1>
          <h2>अर्जुनविषादयोग</h2>
          <p>Arjuna Vishada Yoga - Yoga of despondency of Arjuna</p>
          <p>
            Arjuna the great warrior is overpowered by grief and delusion born
            out of a sense of attachment to his kith and kin. In his delusory
            state, he makes several fallacious arguments to support his decision
            not to fight. This sets the stage for the Lord’s teaching which
            comprises the rest of the Gita. Below are the main themes of Chapter
            1:
          </p>

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          The epic battle of Mahābhārata, fought between the Pāṇḍavas and
          Kauravas is the scenario in which the Gītā-teaching is imparted.
          Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava, discovers the problem of saṃsāra in the
          battlefield. He surrenders to Lord Krishna seeking a solution. Then
          follows the great teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to attain the wisdom that permeates the Gītā one should go
          through the following phases in life:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            One should discover the problem of saṃsāra, for which Gītā happens
            to be a solution. Unless one discovers the disease, one will not
            seek medicine.
          </li>
          <li>
            One should become possessed by a sincere longing (tīvramumukṣā) for
            freedom from saṃsāra. This alone can lead to committed and fruitful
            pursuit.
          </li>
          <li>
            One should realize that one cannot solve this problem independently.
            The maximum that one can do, as a limited human being, is a
            rearrangement or a reshaping of the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            One should surrender to a Guru seeking his guidance. When surrender
            to the Guru happens, the ground is prepared for the Gītā-teaching to
            take place.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The entire first chapter and the first part of the second chapter are
          devoted to show these developments.
        </p>

        <h3>The problem of saṃsāra</h3>
        <p>
          As shown in the first chapter, the problem of saṃsāra can be said to
          be the problem of attachment (kṛpā or rāga), grief (śoka or viṣāda)
          and delusion (moha). When one is not happy with oneself, one has to
          seek external aids. This leads to dependence and attachment. Since the
          conditions of the depended factors are unpredictable, the very peace
          of mind of that person is in trouble. A disturbed mind can make only
          faulty judgments complicating matters further. Thus a vicious cycle is
          created. This, in short, is the problem of saṃsāra.
        </p>

        <h3>Verse details</h3>
        <p>
          Coming to the text, we find, in the first twenty verses, a vivid
          description of the armies arrayed for battle. After a brief
          instruction of Duryodhana to his commanders, Bhīṣma, Lord Krishna,
          Arjuna, and others blow their conches, signaling the commencement of
          the battle (1 to 20).
        </p>

        <p>
          At this fateful moment, Arjuna commands Lord Krishna, his charioteer,
          to place the chariot in the middle of the army to scrutinize the enemy
          forces. The mischievous Lord brings the chariot in front of Bhīṣma and
          Droṇa and asks Arjuna to survey the army (21 to 25).
        </p>

        <p>
          (Till now Arjuna was convinced that his cousins are unrighteous and
          he, as a kṣatriya, has to fight the battle to establish
          righteousness.)
        </p>

        <p>
          In a moment of weakness, Arjuna slips from reason to relation. Instead
          of seeing the violators of dharma, he sees his beloved kith and kin.
          Naturally, Arjuna is overpowered by attachment. Then follow the twin
          offshoots of attachment viz. grief and delusion (26 to 30).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next five verses, we see Arjuna expressing his intense grief
          which shakes him completely. This indicates the extent of his
          attachment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Veiled by attachment, his discriminating power becomes inoperative and
          he commits a series of false judgments. Interestingly enough, Arjuna
          even quotes the scriptures to support his unreasonable stand. Thus,
          Arjuna gets caught up in delusion which is depicted from the 36th
          verse up to the end of the chapter (36 to 47).
        </p>

        <p>
          In this way, Arjuna finds himself in the deep sea of attachment,
          sorrow and delusion (rāga, śoka, moha). Arjuna sincerely wants to get
          out of this problem. He thinks that solution is to drop the battle.
          But, one corner of his mind is not convinced by this. At the same
          time, he has not realized that the problem is too deep for him to
          solve independently. Hence he doesn’t surrender to Krishna either.
          Thus caught up in a dilemma, Arjuna sits back on the chariot
          sorrowfully.
        </p>
