          <p>Vibhūti-Yoga - The Divine Glories</p>
          <p>
            Arjuna acknowledges the Supreme nature of the Lord but asks how He
            can constantly be remembered even as one is perceiving this
            pluralistic world. In response, the Lord provides a long list of His
            glorious manifestations in the perceived universe. Lest anyone
            misunderstand that the Lord is limited to these forms, He concludes
            by saying that there is, in fact, no end to His glories. Below are
            the main themes of Chapter 10:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 1 - 3:</strong> Introduction and the glory of this
              knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 4 - 7:</strong> Lord’s glory in brief and the
              benefit of that knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 8 - 11:</strong> Virāṭ-devotees and the benefit of
              such a devotion.

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the previous three chapters, Lord Kṛṣṇa revealed God as the
          material cause of the universe. Since the effect cannot be different
          from the material cause, it clearly follows that the universe cannot
          be different from God. Thus the entire universe is the divine
          manifestation of God. Hence whatever glories we see in the creation
          belong to the Lord alone. Kṛṣṇa reveals this idea in this chapter as
          the culmination of his teaching of Virāṭ (Viśvarūpam).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the first three verses, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic of vibhūti and
          yoga — vibhūti is the manifestation of Lord and yoga is the power of
          manifestation. Even great sages cannot talk about the glories of the
          Lord because they are finite beings born later. Hence it is the rarest
          knowledge that is given. One who gains this knowledge will be free
          from saṃsāra (1 to 3).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next four verses, the Lord reveals His glory by pointing out
          that the entire subtle universe of thoughts as well as the gross
          universe are born of Him. The seven great sages, the four sages Sanaka
          etc., and the Manus are all born of the mind of the Lord. One who
          knows this attains self-knowledge ultimately (4 to 7).
        </p>

        <p>
          The following four verses deal with the Virāṭ-devotees and the
          benefits of such a devotion. The devotees accept everything as a gift
          of God because God is the source of all. They think about God, speak
          about God, hear about God — in short, they spend their lives revelling
          in God all the time (8, 9). (Still they are saguṇa-devotees only. They
          are ignorant of the highest nature of the Lord.) The Lord says that He
          takes the responsibility of enlightening them. Out of compassion for
          them, the Lord lights up the lamp of knowledge, remaining in their
          heart. (The idea is that the Lord will provide them with a guru and
          the necessary conditions for the knowledge of the highest nature of
          God.) (10, 11).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next seven verses (12 to 18), Arjuna requests Kṛṣṇa to give the
          details of His glories (manifestations) which will help him in
          upāsanā. (Each expression of God in the universe can become a symbol
          for upāsanā. Later, when one sees every glory as the expression of
          God, it becomes the appreciation of Virāṭ. This helps in the expansion
          of the mind.)
        </p>

        <p>
          From verse 19 to the end of the chapter, Bhagavān describes His
          glories. The Lord is careful to add both at the beginning and at the
          end that it is not an exhaustive list of His glories. They are the
          important ones. Nobody can exhaust the glories of the Lord (19, 40).
          Kṛṣṇa begins the enumeration with the very Self. The best, the closest
          and the most evident expression of the Lord is the very ‘I’, the
          consciousness (20). Kṛṣṇa concludes the list by pointing out that He
          is the very existence in all beings because He is the material cause
          (bījam) of all (39). In short, whatever there is which is glorious,
          rich or powerful — all of them are the expressions of only a ray of
          God’s glory (41). In fact, it is not that the Lord’s glory is in the
          world, but the entire world is in the Lord, occupying a part of Him,
          as it were (42). (The world cannot be a part of the Lord in the real
          sense of the term, because it is only apparent as the Lord Himself
          negates it in IX-5.)
