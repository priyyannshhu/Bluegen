          <h2>विश्वरूपदर्शनयोग</h2>
          <p>Viśva-Rūpa-Darśana-Yoga - The Cosmic Form</p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, Lord Krishna gifts Arjuna the divine vision which
            enables him to perceive the Lord in His Cosmic form – a form that
            even the Gods long to see but are unable to. The bulk of the chapter
            comprises of Arjuna describing the various sights he beholds within
            the Lord’s form. Whereas the previous chapter showcased the
            manifestations of the One Supreme Self in the many, this chapter
            completes the narrative by driving home the point that those many
            forms are, in fact, sustained in and part of that One Self, which
            alone is the reality. Below are the main themes of Chapter 11:

        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 11 of the Bhagavad Gita presents a profound moment in Arjuna's
          journey as he witnesses the cosmic form of Lord Krishna. This chapter
          illustrates the divine omnipresence of the Lord and underscores the
          truth that all forms are manifestations of the one Supreme Reality.
          The transition from doubt to realization reflects a universal quest
          for truth and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gift of divine vision symbolizes the elevation of consciousness
          required to perceive the higher truths of existence. Arjuna's
          reactions—wonder, fear, and ultimately devotion—illustrate the
          transformative power of spiritual insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The withdrawal of the universal form signifies the importance of
          devotion and surrender to the divine. This chapter teaches us that
          true knowledge comes from experiencing the divine, leading to a deeper
          understanding of our own nature and the interconnectedness of all
          beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, the Cosmic Form of Krishna embodies the ultimate reality,
          reminding us of the divine presence within and around us.
        </p>

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the previous four chapters, Kṛṣṇa established that the entire
          universe is a manifestation of God and, therefore, any glory in
          creation belongs to God alone. Now, in this chapter, Arjuna
          appreciates this teaching and sees the universe as the very Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first two verses, Arjuna summarizes the entire teaching of
          Kṛṣṇa—the nature of jīva (predominantly discussed in the first six
          chapters) and the nature of God (predominantly discussed in the later
          four chapters). Though Arjuna has received the teaching, he is unable
          to appreciate the universal form due to some mental blocks. Hence, he
          prays to the Lord for the vision of the universal form of the Lord (3,
          4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord Kṛṣṇa agrees to bless Arjuna with the vision of the universal
          form (5 to 7). Since this is not possible to have such a vision with
          ordinary eyes, Kṛṣṇa grants Arjuna the divine eye for this special
          purpose (8). (The universal form is not a special form of the Lord. It
          is the Lord as the universe. As such, it is available for all at all
          times. The Lord need not show it. Still, we miss it because of our
          narrow outlook of the world. Once we refine our mind and look at the
          universe, we cannot miss the Lord. His stamp is there in all, from a
          blade of grass to the farthest star. Such a mind, which is tuned to
          see the Lord, is the divine eye behind the fleshy eyes. It is such an
          eye that Kṛṣṇa granted to Arjuna.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 9th to the 14th verse, we get a description of the universal
          form from Sañjaya. He pictures the Lord as a person with all divine
          ornaments shining with the brilliance of a thousand suns risen
          together. (We should remember that this is a description of the world
          only, divinized by the change of outlook. Every exalted object in
          creation should be taken as an ornament of the Lord.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 15th verse, we get Arjuna’s appreciation of the universal
          form. (Arjuna goes through various phases as he sees the universal
          form. The first response is one of wonder only.) Arjuna sees all
          beings in the cosmic body of the Lord. The sun and the moon are like
          His eyes. He sees the hands, legs, etc., of the people as those of the
          Lord. Now, the Lord’s body with thousands of hands, legs, etc.,
          appears without beginning, middle, or end (15 to 22).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Arjuna’s attention is turned towards the mouth of the Lord, which
          represents Time (Death). With blazing fire and protruding teeth, the
          Lord’s mouth evokes terror in all, including Arjuna. Arjuna sees the
          entire world being scorched by this fire (Time), while many are
          rushing towards the mouth of the Lord. Some are already inside the
          mouth, and some are crushed between the teeth. All these cause great
          fear and confusion in Arjuna, and he begins to doubt whether the Lord
          is a loving father or a terrible destroyer (23 to 31). (This shows
          that Arjuna is still not able to see the Lord as a whole. He is able
          to accept ‘birth’ as part of the universe, but not ‘death.’ This
          partial outlook is the cause of fear and confusion. This is the second
          phase.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the Lord clarifies that the fierce aspect also is Himself,
          manifesting as the Time-principle. When the time comes for people to
          die, the Lord finds the instruments to bring this about, and Arjuna
          happens to be one of them in the hands of the Lord (32 to 34). Having
          understood the Lord to be ‘the cosmic-stage-manager’, Arjuna
          surrenders to His Will and sings His glory (34-45). (Now Arjuna
          appreciates the Lord as totality, the basis of
          creation-preservation-dissolution. In front of the Lord, everything
          else is insignificant. This appreciation makes him a devotee, seeking
          forgiveness for all his past omissions and commissions. Thus, the
          third phase is true devotion to the Lord, born out of right
          understanding.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Arjuna is indeed happy to have this unique vision of the Lord. Still,
          one part of his mind is not able to accept the totality, especially
          the destructive aspect. So, Arjuna requests the Lord to withdraw His
          form (46).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last nine verses (47 to 55), we see the Lord withdrawing His
          universal form (i.e., the Lord takes away the divine eye that Arjuna
          enjoyed till now. Arjuna comes down to look at the world in his own
          private way.) The Lord praises devotion as a means to this cosmic
          vision. This universal form could be seen by Arjuna because of his
          devotion. Through devotion, one can purify the mind, see the universal
          form, know the true nature of the Lord, and become one with the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna – “Do actions for My sake; be My devotee;
          keep Me as the ultimate goal; be detached (from the world); be free
          from hatred towards all. Such a person reaches Me.”
