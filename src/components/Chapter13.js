            Prakṛti-Puruṣa-Viveka-Yoga - The Yoga of Distinguishing Matter from
            Spirit

            and the knower of the field (puruṣa). It emphasizes understanding
            the reality of the Self, transcending the transient and inert
            material envelopments. Below are the main themes of Chapter 13:

        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 13 delves into the profound distinction between the material
          world and the eternal Self. Here, Arjuna seeks knowledge about the
          nature of reality, prompting Lord Krishna to elucidate the differences
          between the field and the knower of the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of Kṣetram and Kṣetrajña is pivotal in this chapter. The
          body is depicted as the field, while the soul or Self is the knower.
          This realization is essential for anyone on the path to enlightenment,
          as it encourages us to look beyond our physical existence and
          recognize our true essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The commentary emphasizes the importance of understanding both prakṛti
          (nature) and puruṣa (spirit) to attain wisdom. The chapter addresses
          the interconnectedness of all beings, highlighting the journey towards
          liberation through self-awareness and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, Chapter 13 serves as a guide to understanding our place in
          the universe, fostering a deeper comprehension of existence and the
          relationship between the material and spiritual realms.
        </p>

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In this chapter, the discourse focuses on the essence of what
          constitutes reality. Understanding the distinctions between the field
          and the knower is fundamental to grasping the teachings of the Gita.
          The exploration of prakṛti and puruṣa reveals the layers of existence
          that often cloud our understanding of the Self.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first six chapters, Lord Kṛṣṇa talked about the nature of jīva
          (tvam-pada) and karmayoga predominantly. In the second six chapters,
          Bhagavān discussed the nature of Īśvara (tat-pada) and upāsanā
          predominantly — especially virāḍ-upāsanā. When a seeker goes through
          these stages of understanding and sādhanam, he becomes ready for
          jñānayoga which is the recognition of the identity between the jīva
          and Īśvara (asi-pada). This is the topic which will be dealt with in
          the following six chapters.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter offers insights into the nature of knowledge and the
          importance of discerning the material from the spiritual. Recognizing
          the eternal within the transient is a key theme, guiding practitioners
          toward a deeper spiritual awakening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thirteenth chapter is presented in the form of six topics —
          kṣetram, kṣetrajña, jñānam, jñeyam, puruṣa, and prakṛti. Though these
          are discussed separately, we should note that kṣetrajña, jñeyam, and
          puruṣa are the same essentially. Similarly, kṣetram and prakṛti are
          essentially the same.
        </p>

        <h4>Kṣetram</h4>
        <p>
          The entire objective universe is kṣetram. From the beginningless
          prakṛti (avyaktam) everything experienced by us comes under this. It
          includes mahat (cosmic intellect), ahaṅkāra (cosmic ego), the subtle
          and gross elements, sense organs of action and perception, the mind
          and its modifications (6, 7). Still, Kṛṣṇa specially mentions the body
          as kṣetram (2) because we generally do not see the body as part of the
          universe.
        </p>

        <h4>Kṣetrajña</h4>
        <p>
          That conscious principle which illumines the kṣetram is called
          kṣetrajña (2). Having defined kṣetrajña, Kṛṣṇa reveals that the
          kṣetrajña is none other than the Lord (i.e. Brahman) Himself who is
          the consciousness in all bodies (3). Thus, kṣetrajña is one
          all-pervading consciousness. (This kṣetrajña alone is called jīva. So,
          the idea given here is the essential identity of jīva and Īśvara.)
        </p>

        <h4>Jñānam</h4>
        <p>
          From the 8th to the 12th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about some important
          values which prepare the mind for Self-knowledge. They are: humility,
          simplicity, non-violence, forbearance, honesty, service to the
          teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control, detachment from sense
          objects, absence of egoism, constant awareness of the misery in birth,
          death, etc., dispassion, non-identification with son, wife, house,
          etc., being always equanimous in desirable and undesirable situations,
          unswerving devotion to the Lord, seclusion, non-indulgence in people’s
          company, constant self-enquiry, and not losing sight of the fruit of
          Self-knowledge.
        </p>

        <h4>Jñeyam</h4>
        <p>
          In the next six verses (13th to 18th), Kṛṣṇa talks about the Truth
          which is to be known. It is beginningless, beyond sat and asat (13),
          all-pervading, subtle, far (for the ignorant), and near (for the wise)
          (16). Though undivided, it appears divided, and it is the creator,
          sustainer, and destroyer of all (17). It is the light of consciousness
          which resides in the heart of all (18). Being subtle, it cannot be
          known in its pure form. Yet, it shines in the body (as
          Awareness-Existence) and in the world (as Existence). One has to
          recognize it as pure Awareness-Existence by distinguishing it from the
          body and the world (14, 15). (This method of teaching is called
          adhyāropa-apavāda-prakriyā i.e. the method of superimposition and
          negation.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Having talked about these four topics, Kṛṣṇa glorifies this knowledge
          as the one which leads the seeker to Him (19).
        </p>

        <h4>Puruṣa and Prakṛti</h4>
        <p>
          Now comes the last pair, puruṣa and prakṛti (20 to 24). Both are
          beginning-less. Blessed by puruṣa, prakṛti creates everything (20 and
          27). (Though beginningless, puruṣa and prakṛti are of opposite nature.
          While puruṣa is conscious, changeless, and real, prakṛti is inert,
          changing, and unreal.) The body, the mind, and their activities belong
          to prakṛti, whereas puruṣa is a mere illuminator of all these (21).
          When puruṣa obtains in the body as kṣetrajña, it seems to be a kartā,
          bhoktā, etc. But as paramātmā, the absolute, it is ever unaffected and
          is ever the same (23). Not knowing this, when puruṣa (i.e. kṣetrajña)
          identifies with the body and its guṇas, then all limitations and the
          consequent problems arise (22). One who has the discriminative
          knowledge of puruṣa and prakṛti attains immortality (24).
        </p>

        <p>
          In the following verses (25th and 35th) Kṛṣṇa sums up the teaching and
          presents its sādhanam and phalam. The wise man is one who always
          abides in the Self, which is the same everywhere (28 and 29), which is
          actionless (30), and which is unaffected (32) like the space or like
          the light (34). The Self is not only the illuminator of everything
          (34) but also the substratum of the whole universe (31). In fact,
          there is no universe other than the Self (35). One who has assimilated
          this wisdom is Brahman itself (31) and attains the supreme goal of
          liberation (35).
        </p>

        <p>
          To gain this knowledge, one has to purify the mind through karmayoga,
          gain knowledge through enquiry (sāṅkhya-yoga), and ultimately get
          established in the knowledge through dhyānayoga (25 and 26).
