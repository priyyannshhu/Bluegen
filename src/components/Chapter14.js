          <p>
            In this chapter, the Lord explains the concept of the threefold
            "guna," which conditions all matter, helping us understand the
            endless variety of forms and experiences in the universe. The goal
            is to transcend these gunas to realize our true, immortal nature.

        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 14 of the Bhagavad Gita, known as Guṇa-Traya-Vibhāga-Yoga,
          delves into the nature of the three guṇas: sattva (purity), rajas
          (passion), and tamas (inertia). These qualities, which arise from
          Prakriti (Nature), bind the soul to the material world. Each guṇa has
          distinct characteristics that influence human behavior, emotions, and
          thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sattva, characterized by harmony and wisdom, binds through attachment
          to knowledge and happiness. Rajas, associated with desire and
          restlessness, binds by attachment to action and results. Tamas, linked
          with ignorance and darkness, binds through attachment to lethargy and
          confusion. Understanding these guṇas is essential for transcending
          their influence and attaining spiritual liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord emphasizes that one must rise above these three guṇas to
          realize their true, immortal Self. The qualities of a person who has
          transcended the guṇas are discussed, along with the means to achieve
          such a state through devotion and self-realization.
        </p>

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>The Concept of Guṇas</h3>
        <p>
          The three guṇas are fundamental qualities that govern all of
          existence. They are present in different proportions in all beings and
          objects, resulting in the diversity we observe. The challenge lies in
          recognizing the predominance of a specific guṇa and striving for
          balance while ultimately aiming to transcend their limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve liberation (moksha), one must transcend the influence of
          these guṇas through steady self-awareness and spiritual practice
          (sādhanā). This chapter not only explains the effects of each guṇa but
          also guides seekers toward the path of transcendence, describing the
          characteristics of a person who is free from the guṇas.
        </p>

        <h3>The Path to Transcendence</h3>
        <p>
          Knowledge (jnana) serves as a key to rise above the guṇas. It allows
          one to understand the nature of existence and the Self's true nature,
          beyond the physical and mental experiences shaped by the guṇas.
          Through consistent practice and detachment, one can overcome their
          influence and experience the Self's pure consciousness.
