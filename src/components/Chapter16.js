            Daivasura Sampad Vibhaga Yoga - The Yoga of the Division between the
            Divine and Demoniacal Traits
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 16 of the Bhagavad Gita discusses the nature of divine and
            demoniacal qualities, providing insights into human behavior and
            guiding individuals towards self-improvement. The chapter highlights
            the characteristics of a person with divine qualities (Daivi Sampad)
            and contrasts them with the traits of someone possessing demoniacal
            qualities (Asuri Sampad). Here are the main themes of Chapter 16:
          </p>

          "Verse 6: There are two types of beings in this world—the divine and the demoniacal. The divine has been described at length; now hear from me about the demoniacal.",
          "Verse 7: The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity nor right conduct nor truth is found in them.",
          "Verse 8: They say that the universe is without truth, without a moral basis, and without a God; it is brought about by the union of the male and female and has no other cause than desire.",

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the previous three chapters (XIII, XIV, and XV), Bhagavān talked
          about Self-knowledge (jñānayoga), which is the direct means for
          liberation. In the following two chapters, Kṛṣṇa discusses the values
          to be followed by a seeker. Though values themselves do not give
          liberation, they are necessary to gain knowledge. They alone prepare
          the mind and make it fit for receiving the knowledge. In fact, Vedānta
          is a pramāṇa (means of knowledge) only for a prepared mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this chapter, Kṛṣṇa divides all mental traits into two groups —
          daivī-sampat and āsurī-sampat. All sattvic traits come under the
          former, while rajasic and tamasic traits come under the latter.
          Daivī-sampat is conducive to Self-knowledge; āsurī-sampat is an
          obstacle to spiritual pursuit. Without exception, everyone in this
          universe falls under one of these two groups. From this, it is evident
          that all seekers of knowledge must necessarily lead a spiritual
          (sattvic) life, avoiding materialistic (rajasic and tamasic)
          tendencies.
        </p>

        <h3>Daivī-sampat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fearlessness</li>
          <li>Purity</li>

          <li>Gentleness</li>
          <li>Modesty</li>
          <li>Steadfastness and absence of restlessness</li>
          <li>Strength</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Āsurī-sampat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Vanity</li>
          <li>Arrogance</li>
          <li>Pretension</li>
          <li>Anger</li>
          <li>Cruelty</li>
          <li>Ignorance</li>
          <li>Impurity</li>
          <li>Absence of religious discipline</li>
          <li>Absence of truthfulness</li>
          <li>Absence of faith in God</li>
          <li>Endless desire for sense-pleasure</li>
          <li>Delusion</li>
          <li>False values</li>
          <li>Worry</li>
          <li>Attachment</li>
          <li>Greed</li>
          <li>Egoism</li>
          <li>Slander</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Āsurī-sampat leads a person astray, causing spiritual destruction
          ultimately. Kṛṣṇa sums up the entire āsurī-sampat as the three basic
          materialistic traits of desire, anger, and greed. They are the
          three-fold gateway to hell. When one avoids these three traits and
          adopts the divine virtues, daivī-sampat, one becomes qualified for
          Self-knowledge and attains liberation soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Lord concludes the chapter by pointing out that śāstra is the
          pramāṇa in determining what is right and wrong. One should know what
          the scriptures say and act accordingly.
        </p>
