          <h1>Gita Ch 17 - Shraddha Traya Vibhaga Yoga</h1>
          <h2>श्रद्धात्रयविभागयोग</h2>
          <p>
            Sraddhā-Traya-Vibhāga-Yoga - The Yoga of Differentiating Threefold
            Faith
          </p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, the Lord shows how the concept of “guna” that was
            detailed in the 14th chapter applies to faith, worship, food,
            sacrifices/rituals, austerities, and charity. The Lord explains that
            these common activities can each be categorized as sattvic, rajasic,
            or tamasic depending on the manner in which they are conducted. Our
            goal is to engage in only the sattvic varieties since that alone is
            conducive to spiritual development. Below are the main themes of
            Chapter 17:

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the previous chapter, Bhagavān said that śāstra is the pramāṇa in
          determining what is right and wrong and that one should act according
          to what śāstra says. Based on this, Arjuna raises a question here —
          “To what category does a person belong if he worships with faith
          without scriptural knowledge – sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic?” (1)
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa answers that he may belong to any category according to his
          temperament. An ignorant person’s faith will depend on his nature
          since he has no scriptural knowledge to guide. (By observing various
          types of worship done by others, he develops his faith according to
          his character. On the other hand, a person who goes by the scriptural
          teaching will invariably have sattvic faith) (2, 3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa differentiates three types of faith based upon the object of
          worship (4). Even the nature of worship varies according to faith.
          People of tamasic faith take to severe practices involving torture of
          the body etc. (5, 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having answered Arjuna’s question, Kṛṣṇa discusses a few more topics
          namely food, yajña, tapas and charity, differentiating them into three
          types based on the guṇas (7 to 22). (Refer to the chart below.) [A
          seeker has to choose the sattvic type i.e. daivī-sampat and avoid
          rajasic and tamasic types i.e. āsurī-sampat.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagavān concludes the teaching mentioning the significance of the
          mantra “Om tat sat”. This originated from Brahmā’s mouth in the
          beginning of creation, and has been traditionally chanted during
          scriptural activities like yajña, tapas and dāna. The word ‘sat’ has
          many meanings like existence, goodness, good action, steadfastness and
          an action as an offering to the Lord (23 to 27). [In essence the
          utterance of this mantra will sanctify scriptural actions and make
          them sattvic.]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last verse, Kṛṣṇa emphasizes the importance of śraddhā (faith).
          Without faith all scriptural activities become asat, i.e. fruitless
          (28).
        </p>

        <h3>The topics of this chapter are:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Arjuna’s question and three types of śraddhā: 1 to 6</li>
          <li>Kṛṣṇa introduces new topics: 7</li>
          <li>Three types of food: 8 to 10</li>
          <li>Three types of yajña: 11 to 13</li>
          <li>Three types of tapas (based on instrument): 14 to 16</li>
          <li>Three types of tapas (based on guṇa): 17 to 19</li>
          <li>Three types of charity: 20 to 22</li>
          <li>Significance of “om tat sat” and conclusion: 23 to 28</li>
        </ul>

          and in the end, this chapter is called{" "}
