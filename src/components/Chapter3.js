          <p>Karma Yoga - Path of Selfless Service</p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, the Lord teaches the importance of action and
            explains why and how one must act in the world so that the mind and
            intellect are purified and relieved of their false attachments,
            thereby making them receptive to the Self-knowledge that was
            emphasized in the previous chapter. Below are the main themes of

          "Verse 10: 'The Creator, having in the beginning created mankind together with sacrifice, said, “By this shall you propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires—the cow that yields all the desired objects.”'",

        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, Krishna emphasizes the significance of performing
          one's duty without attachment to the results. This is the essence of
          Karma Yoga, where one acts selflessly for the benefit of society and
          the world. The focus shifts from renunciation to the understanding
          that action performed in accordance with one's dharma purifies the
          mind and leads to self-realization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arjuna's initial confusion regarding knowledge and action highlights a
          common dilemma faced by individuals. Krishna clarifies that both paths
          are valid, yet action is essential in the worldly context. He urges
          Arjuna to fulfill his responsibilities as a warrior while remaining
          detached from the outcomes, thus achieving true freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter also discusses the role of a wise person who engages in
          selfless action. Such individuals inspire others by their example and
          contribute positively to the collective consciousness. The ultimate
          goal of Karma Yoga is to transcend desires and attachments, leading to
          a higher understanding of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this chapter serves as a powerful reminder of the importance
          of action, the balance between duty and detachment, and the path to
          selfless service as a means to attain spiritual wisdom.

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the second chapter, the Lord praised Self-knowledge right from the
          beginning (11, 21, 46) and criticized the karma-kāṇḍa of the Vedas (42
          to 45). Thereafter, He asked Arjuna to take to karma (48). This
          creates a serious doubt in Arjuna and the third chapter begins with
          this doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arjuna asks—“Oh Lord! You seem to confuse me by contradictory
          statements. Tell me one—knowledge or karma—which will lead me to
          Mokṣa” (1, 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagavān answers that there are two lifestyles called
          karma-yoga-niṣṭhā (social life) and jñāna-yoga-niṣṭhā (secluded life).
          One can choose anyone of them as a householder or as a monk (3).
        </p>
        <p>
          (But there is no choice between karma and knowledge. Whatever
          lifestyle one chooses, one has to follow relevant karma for purity and
          then pursue knowledge to discover the freedom that is one’s true
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these two lifestyles, Kṛṣṇa gives preference to social life
          throughout the Gītā. In the Upaniṣads, we find the latter emphasized.
          Choice depends on the maturity of the seeker.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 4th to the 7th verse, Kṛṣṇa condemns inaction and praises an
          alert and active life. Inaction should be avoided because:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Neither purity nor knowledge can be achieved by that (4);</li>
          <li>
            Desires force one to act and inaction will be a suppression (5);
          </li>
          <li>
            A mind without occupation will be idle. It will brood over
            sense-pleasures. Such a hypocritical mind will soon fall (6). (Also
            refer II-62, 63)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          From the 8th to the 20th verse (1st line), Bhagavān deals with one of
          the most beautiful and important topics of the Gītā viz. karma-yoga.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having created the world and the intelligent human beings, the Lord
          Himself advocated (in the Vedas) the way of life which is karma-yoga.
          By following this, material and spiritual progress can be attained (10
          to 14).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it is the teaching of the Lord, the Master of the universe
          (Svāmī), human beings have to take it as a command (niyatam) and obey
          it as a servant (bhṛtya) of the Lord (8).
        </p>
        <p>
          When we follow the teachings of the Lord, it becomes a gesture of our
          appreciation for all the gifts and blessings that the Lord has
          bestowed upon us. Thus, our work becomes a worship or loving offering
          (yajña) to God. It purifies the mind also (9, 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, karma-yoga is necessary to maintain the harmony of the
          universe upon which we are dependent. The working of the universe
          being a cyclic process, with the human beings as its important link,
          one must be aware of one’s responsibility (duty). Thus, karma-yoga is
          only the duty (kāryam) of a responsible citizen of the world. One who
          does not discharge it proves himself/herself to be an immature human
          being (14 to 16).
        </p>
        <p>Thus, karma-yoga is to be pursued because:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It contributes to material and spiritual progress (yoga).</li>
          <li>
            It is the commandment (niyatam) of the Master of the universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is our grateful offering (yajña) to the Lord, acknowledging His
            gifts.
          </li>
          <li>It is the only way of maintaining harmony (dharma).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          (In this chapter, Bhagavān does not talk about kāmya-karma — actions
          to fulfill the desires. This shows that true karma-yoga does not
          involve kāmya-karma. Hence a seeker must gradually reduce kāmya-karma,
          even to become a true karma-yogī.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Karma-yoga ultimately leads one to liberation through the stages of
          purity (śuddhi), enquiry (vicāra), and knowledge (jñānam) (17, 18).
          Kṛṣṇa concludes the topic by citing the example of Janaka who
          successfully pursued knowledge while remaining in karma-yoga-niṣṭhā
          (social life) (20, 1st line).
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 20th (2nd line) to the 29th verse, the Lord talks about the
          role of a wise man in society, taking Arjuna as one. Any person with a
          higher status or knowledge (śreṣṭha) can influence others positively
          or negatively. Hence, even though Arjuna might not benefit from this
          war, he has to fight as a kṣaṭriya’s duty and set an example for
          others. Else, he will be responsible for anarchy in his own time as
          well as in the future (22 to 25).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, both the wise and the ignorant should act — the former for
          teaching others, and the latter, for purity. The only difference is
          that the former will be detached while the latter won’t be (27 to 29).
        </p>
        <p>The 30th verse summarizes karma-yoga, giving five conditions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Keep the spiritual goal.</li>
          <li>Offer all actions to the Lord.</li>
          <li>Don’t be concerned about the result.</li>
          <li>Be free from possessiveness; and</li>
          <li>Be calm.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          One who follows karma-yoga reaches the goal of life, and the other is
          lost (31, 32).
        </p>
        <p>
          Likes and dislikes (rāga-dveṣa) born of habits (vāsanas) pull a person
          astray. Still, a person should not go by what he likes to do but what
          he has to do (duty), even if it involves difficulties (33 to 35).
        </p>
        <p>
          As an answer to Arjuna’s question (36), Kṛṣṇa elaborately discusses
          the problem of kāma-krodha (rāga-dveṣa). They are the real enemies of
          a seeker (37). Clouding the knowledge, they force a person to run
          after endless insatiable desires and take away all the chances of
          peace and progress (38, 39). The senses, the mind, and the intellect
          are the base of desires. They have to be taken care of (40, 41).
        </p>
        <p>
          (Durvāsanās should be replaced by śubhavāsanās by practice. False
          values should be replaced by right ones through discrimination.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Once kāma becomes weak, one can discover the Ātmā, which is beyond the
          senses, the mind, and the intellect, and thus destroy kāma for good
          (42, 43).
