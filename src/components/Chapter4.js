          <h1>Gita Ch 04 - Jnana Karma Sanyasa Yoga</h1>
          <h2>ज्ञानकर्मसंन्यासयोग</h2>
          <p>Jñāna Karma Sanyāsa Yoga - Approaching the Ultimate Truth</p>
          <p>
            Having emphasized the importance of action in the previous chapter,
            here the Lord begins a gradual transition to the superiority of
            pursuing knowledge. The virtues of the man of knowledge are
            highlighted, and various worldly practices (sadhanas) are described
            as being rooted in action. However, the Lord concludes the chapter
            by urging Arjuna to act, as right actions are essential for
            preparing the mind for knowledge. Below are the main themes of
            Chapter 4:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 1 - 8:</strong> Gītā-stuti and avatāra (the divine
              descent).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 9 - 15:</strong> Knowledge of avatāra and its
              effects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 16 - 24:</strong> The wisdom of seeing inaction in
              action and vice versa (characteristics of the wise).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 25 - 34:</strong> The glory and the means of
              acquiring knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 35 - 37:</strong> The benefits of gaining this
              knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 38 - 42:</strong> Qualifications and
              disqualifications for attaining knowledge.

          "Verse 16: What is action? What is inaction? Even the wise are confused about this. Therefore, I shall teach you the nature of action and inaction, by knowing which you will be liberated from the evil of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death.",

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Kṛṣṇa dealt with karmayoga and sāṅkhyayoga in the third and
          second chapters respectively. These two yogas are not newly introduced
          by Kṛṣṇa. It has been initiated by the Lord in the beginning of the
          creation itself through the karma-kāṇḍa and jñāna-kāṇḍa of the Vedas.
          Thus, this is an ancient wisdom which has stood the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa begins the fourth chapter by referring to the above aspect so
          that Arjuna will have reverence for Gītā. The Lord points out that He
          initiated the lineage of Vivasvān (Lord Sun), Manu, Ikṣvāku, and
          others in the beginning of the creation (through the Vedas). It is the
          same ancient Vedic wisdom which is being revived by Lord Kṛṣṇa through
          Arjuna in the form of the Gītā because it had declined by that time
          (2, 3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Arjuna wonders how Kṛṣṇa, who is his contemporary, can be the
          initiator of the ancient Vedic wisdom (4). As an answer to this
          question, Kṛṣṇa introduces the topic of avatāra (5 to 8). We are born
          because of our own karma (vyaṣṭi-karma) as well as the total karma of
          the world (samaṣṭi-karma). In the case of the Lord, His own karma is
          not there. Thus the karma of the world becomes the cause for the birth
          of the Lord. The evil actions of the wicked and the noble worship of
          the saints necessitate the manifestation (avatāra) of the Lord to
          punish the former and bless the latter. Thus, the Lord establishes
          dharma in the universe (7, 8). But, since this birth is only through
          māyā, it is apparent. Hence it does not affect the true birth-less
          nature of the Lord (6). Moreover, since māyā is under the control of
          the Lord, His omniscience, omnipotence, etc. are not veiled. He
          remembers all the past as well as His true nature. It is from this
          standpoint that Kṛṣṇa says “I initiated the Vedic tradition.”
        </p>

        <h3>The wisdom of action</h3>
        <p>
          From the 9th to the 15th verse, the Lord talks about His true nature
          and its knowledge. Though the Lord seems to be active, He is free from
          all activities and their results (13, 14). He is akartā and abhoktā.
          One who recognizes this nature of the Lord also becomes liberated
          i.e., becomes free from actions and their results (9). This shows that
          the true nature of the Lord and jīva is one and the same. But, being
          interested in the pursuit of various types of means and ends, one does
          not turn to this liberating knowledge (12). Still, some people manage
          to become one with the Lord by freeing the mind from attachment,
          hatred, and fear, by surrendering to the Lord, and by finally gaining
          Self-knowledge (10). The Lord gives whatever the devotee seeks (11).
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 16th to the 25th verse, Kṛṣṇa gives the knowledge of the
          nature of action and inaction and the characteristics of the person of
          such knowledge. Having talked about the rareness of such knowledge
          (16, 17), the Lord defines a wise man as one who sees actionlessness
          (of the Self) amidst the activities (of the body) as well as the
          potential action in the seemingly inactive body (18).
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is that the wise man accepts activities at the level of the
          body because no one can expect relaxation at the body level. The very
          process of life is the continuous function of the body. One should
          only discover inner relaxation even amidst the activities by
          recognizing the true ‘I’ as the actionless Self. Therefore, true and
          complete renunciation is possible only through knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, the wise man never sees anything other than Brahman, that
          being the truth of all (25). Whether his body is active (20) or not
          (21), he is not affected. He is self-sufficient, contented,
          independent, equanimous, and free from fancies, desires, expectations,
          attachments, and jealousy. His actions are meant for the worship of
          the Lord which uplifts humanity (22, 23).
        </p>

        <h3>Verse details</h3>
        <p>
          From the 25th to the 34th verse, the Lord talks about the superiority
          of knowledge over all the other sādhanas and the way of getting that
          knowledge. Various sādhanas are compared to yajñas. They are:
          Brahmajñāna-yajña, deva-yajña, viṣayabhoga-yajña, dama-yajña,
          śama-yajña, prāṇāyāma-yajña, and āhāraniyama-yajña. All sādhanas lead
          one to liberation by preparing the mind. But, being the direct means
          to liberation, Brahmajñāna-yajña is superior to all (33). To get this
          knowledge one should approach a guru who is established in the Truth
          (Tattva-darśi) and who has the necessary language to communicate it
          (jñānī). Such a teacher must be approached with humility, faith, and
          reverence and asked for this knowledge. Instructed by them through the
          scriptures, one gains knowledge; not otherwise (34).
        </p>
        <p>
          From the 35th to the 37th verse, Kṛṣṇa talks about the benefit of this
          knowledge. Gaining the knowledge, one will not get into delusion once
          again. For, he sees everything in the Lord as well as in him (i.e., he
          recognizes his identity with the Lord) (35). By this boat of
          knowledge, one crosses over the ocean of sin however vast it may be
          (36). Like a blazing fire, this knowledge reduces to ashes (renders
          inoperative) all the karmas (37). Hence, knowledge is the greatest
          purifier. All other sādhanas can produce puṇya which itself is a
          bondage. Moreover, no other sādhana can destroy ignorance which is the
          root cause of all sins. That seeker who has purified the mind will
          soon attain knowledge by the teaching of a guru (38).
        </p>
