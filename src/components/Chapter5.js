          <h2>कर्मसंन्यासयोग</h2>
          <p>Karma Vairagya Yoga - Action and Renunciation</p>
          <p>
            This chapter serves as a bridge between the action-oriented life
            extolled by the Lord in the previous two chapters and the life of
            contemplation that follows. The emphasis here is on renunciation,
            but the Lord makes it clear that this is a state of mind. He
            explains the qualities of a true renunciate. Below are the main
            themes of Chapter 5:

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In the fourth chapter, Lord Kṛṣṇa talked about knowledge and
          renunciation. He referred to the wise man as one whose karmas are
          burnt by the fire of knowledge (IV-19). He glorified the wise man as
          one who is free from possessions, whose only activity is the
          maintenance of the body (IV-21), and who is happy with anything that
          comes due to prārabdha-karma (IV-22). Evidently, these are the signs
          of a monk. At the same time, Kṛṣṇa concludes the chapter by advising
          Arjuna to take to action (IV-42). Naturally, Arjuna is not able to
          reconcile Kṛṣṇa’s various statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secluded life and active life are only two lifestyles. The first is
          called āśrama-sannyāsa (sānkhya, in this chapter), and the latter is
          called karma-yoga (yoga, in this chapter). In both lifestyles, one is
          identified with the equipments. He is a kartā, and hence a saṃsārī.
          This shows that lifestyle itself cannot give liberation. When
          Self-knowledge is gained, one discovers that he is akartā, abhoktā,
          and hence asaṃsārī. Thus, the renunciation of body-identification is
          true sannyāsa, which is called jñānakarma-sannyāsa. This sannyāsa can
          coexist with active life because it is mental renunciation, whereas
          āśrama-sannyāsa cannot coexist with active life because it is physical
          renunciation. Kṛṣṇa advises Arjuna to remain in society and attain the
          goal of jñānakarma-sannyāsa, but Arjuna mistakes sannyāsa for
          āśrama-sannyāsa and sees a contradiction in Kṛṣṇa’s teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter begins with Arjuna’s doubt as to how a person can remain
          in duty and be free from actions at the same time. Kṛṣṇa reintroduces
          the two lifestyles, as discussed in chapter III-3, and says that
          either lifestyle can help a person achieve mokṣa (liberation through
          knowledge). Both lifestyles require a relative freedom from rāga
          (attachment) and dveṣa (aversion), which are essential conditions for
          Self-knowledge. Of the two, Kṛṣṇa recommends active life as more
          suitable for a common man, as a secluded life is difficult to pursue
          without maturity (verses 2 to 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next six verses, the Lord discusses karmayoga and the stages of
          progress. A karmayogī dedicates all physical and mental actions to the
          Lord without concern for the results. Because of this attitude, the
          results do not cause any reactions in his mind. Gradually, he develops
          self-control and ultimately discovers his true nature, which is the
          same in all beings. This is achieved through the guidance of a guru.
          This state is referred to as jñānakarma-sannyāsa (verses 7 to 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following verses (13 to 21) describe the characteristics of a wise
          man and his wisdom. Having discovered his identity with the pure Self,
          he realizes his nature aligns with that of the Self. In his presence,
          all the organs function, yet he neither acts nor instigates anyone.
          The organs act according to their nature, and he remains unaffected by
          good and evil outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of ignorance, one may still be deluded (verse 15). When
          Self-ignorance is destroyed by Self-knowledge, Brahman, the true
          nature, becomes evident (verse 16). Established in Brahman through
          śravaṇam (listening), mananam (reflection), and nididhyāsanam
          (meditation), these wise individuals revel in Brahman. Freed from all
          impurities, they attain videhamukti, a state of liberation from which
          there is no return (verse 17). They recognize the one homogeneous
          awareness-existence behind all beings as their substratum (verse 18).
          Having discovered their identity with the unaffected Brahman, they
          transcend mortality here and now (verse 19).
        </p>
        <p>
          Though prārabdha karma brings both favorable and unfavorable
          circumstances, these spontaneous, delusion-free wise men are neither
          elated nor dejected (verse 20). Detached from the world and
          established in Brahman, they experience infinite ānanda (bliss) (verse
          21).
        </p>
        <p>
          In verses 22 and 23, the importance of vairāgyam (detachment) is
          emphasized. A seeker must detach from sensual pleasures to attain
          infinite bliss. A discriminative seeker, aware of the impermanence of
          these pleasures, refrains from indulging in them (verse 22). One who
          can control the impulses of kāma (desire) and krodha (anger) is a true
          self-controlled person capable of enjoying life (verse 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Verses 24 to 26 discuss videhamukti. Jīvanmuktās (liberated while
          living) who rejoice in themselves, are pure-minded, love all beings,
          and possess doubt-free knowledge of the Ātmā achieve oneness with
          Brahman (videhamukti) upon the body's dissolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having clarified Arjuna’s doubt, Kṛṣṇa briefly addresses meditation in
          the last three verses, to be elaborated upon in the next chapter.
          Although doubtless knowledge can be achieved through śravaṇam and
          mananam, the ingrained belief that “I am the body” prevents this
          knowledge from manifesting as joy. Thus, one must assimilate the
          teaching through continuous meditation (nididhyāsanam).
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing all thoughts related to sense objects, withdrawing the
          senses, regulating breathing, and being free from desire, fear, and
          anger, one should meditate with the intention of attaining mokṣa
          (liberation). Such a yogī attains permanent liberation (verses 27 and
          28).
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding the Lord as the receiver of all sacrifices, the
          supreme Lord of all worlds, and the friend of all beings, a wise
          person attains peace (verse 29).
