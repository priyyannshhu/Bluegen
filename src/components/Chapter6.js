        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Kṛṣṇa introduced the topic of meditation towards the end of the
          last chapter. Being an important topic, Kṛṣṇa spends almost the whole
          of this chapter dealing with meditation. Here, meditation is upon the
          Lord as the very Self (Ātmā) of the meditator. This is meant to
          assimilate the Self-knowledge gained from the guru’s teaching. The
          conditioning that “I am the body” will go only with the assimilation
          of the Self-knowledge. Assimilated Self-knowledge alone can express as
          ānanda.
        </p>
        <p>Kṛṣṇa talks about five important topics on meditation. They are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. <strong>Bahiraṅga-sādhanā</strong> — Those disciplines to be
            followed throughout daily life which influence one’s meditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. <strong>Antaraṅga-sādhanā</strong> — Those disciplines to be
            followed immediately before meditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. <strong>Dhyāna-svarūpam</strong> — Nature of meditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. <strong>Dhyāna-phalam</strong> — Result of meditation.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. <strong>Dhyāna-pratibandha-parihārau</strong> — Obstacle and
            remedy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bahiraṅga-sādhanā</h3>
        <p>
          At the outset, the Lord indicates the role of karmayoga in meditation
          by praising the karmayogī (1, 2). Karmayoga, being a conscious way of
          life, helps one in getting self-control. It converts an extrovert mind
          into a contemplative mind. Once this is achieved, one should try to
          lead a quieter life, because active life becomes an obstacle to
          meditation (3). Total detachment is the characteristic of a
          contemplative mind (4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Incidentally, Kṛṣṇa highlights two important values viz.
          self-confidence and self-control. One who lacks these two finds
          himself to be an obstacle for any pursuit. On the other hand, one who
          enjoys the above two virtues finds himself to be a supporting force in
          every field (5, 6). Soon he is established in the vision of the Ātmā,
          the vision of equality (7 to 9).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa mentions a few other disciplines also, like moderation in
          eating, sleeping, working, and resting (16, 17).
        </p>

        <h3>Antaraṅga-sādhanā</h3>
        <p>
          The meditator has to choose a secluded, undisturbed place for
          meditation (10). In that spiritually and physically pure place, he has
          to fix the seat which is neither too high nor too low, neither too
          soft nor too hard (11). Holding the body, neck, and head erect, he has
          to fix the sight on the tip of his nose, as it were (i.e., the eyes
          are half-closed) (13). Next, the meditator should withdraw the mind
          and sense organs from all other activities. The breathing also should
          be maintained even (refer V-27). With a calm, withdrawn, undisturbed,
          tension-free, and one-pointed mind, the meditator should meditate upon
          the Lord, the Ātmā (12, 14).
        </p>

        <h3>Dhyāna-svarūpam and Phalam</h3>
        <p>
          Meditation is nothing but abidance of the withdrawn mind in the Ātmā
          (18). Having given up all desires and having restrained the senses
          through the mind, one should gradually bring back the mind with the
          help of the discriminative intellect, step by step. Once the mind is
          made to abide in the Ātmā, there should be no other thought (25).
          Though the mind may get distracted, one has to bring it back from the
          respective fields to one’s own Ātmā (26).
        </p>
        <p>
          (All this presupposes a clear understanding of Vedānta. Everything,
          including thoughts, is an object of the Ātmā, the Awareness. The Ātmā
          is not an object for me to be thought of, or to be experienced. It is
          the very “I”. Thus, to knock off all expectations and struggles and to
          abide as the Ātmā with the knowledge that “I am the Ātmā” is true
          meditation.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, constantly abiding in the Ātmā, the meditator comes to enjoy
          permanent peace which culminates in the attainment of liberation
          (videhamukti) (15). He enjoys an ever-abiding mind which is completely
          satisfied with the discovery of the Ātmā (20). Since his ānanda is not
          sensual, it transcends all the limits. Having discovered this inner
          fullness, he never loses sight of his true nature (21, 27, 28).
          Neither does he consider any other gain to be superior, nor is he
          shaken by even the greatest loss (22). This infinite ānanda will never
          be lost because this was never gained. It was veiled by the false
          notion that “I am sorrowful”. Once this is removed, the inner ānanda
          becomes evident. Thus, this is more a dissociation from sorrow rather
          than association (23). (This alone is known as jīvanmukti.) Seeing the
          Ātmā in all beings, and all beings in the Ātmā, he gets established in
          the vision of equality (29). This vision of the Ātmā alone is the
          vision of the Lord, because the Ātmā is not different from the Lord.
          Thus the meditator is ever established in the Lord in spite of his
          activities (30, 31). Being established in the Ātmā, he looks at all
          bodies including his body with the same attitude of detachment. Hence
          he is free from selfishness and is spontaneously established in
          dharma. He is a saint (32).
        </p>

        <h3>Dhyāna-pratibandha-parihārau</h3>
        <p>
          Now, Arjuna puts a question regarding an obstacle to meditation. It is
          the problem of mental restlessness or extrovertedness. Because of
          this, one finds it difficult to meditate and assimilate the
          Self-knowledge. This frustrates Arjuna’s mind and he asks for a
          solution (33, 34).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa gives two methods to solve this problem. They are detachment and
          practice. When the mind is extrovert because of desires, one has to
          remove it by seeing the futility of desires and their fulfillment.
          This is detachment. Even a detached mind can be restless because of
          past habits. This has to be gradually removed by consistent practice
          alone. Thus, mental discipline requires determination and patience
          (35, 36).
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, Arjuna feels diffident and he, somehow, thinks that liberation
          is not possible in one life. He desperately asks Kṛṣṇa—“What happens
          to that seeker who has fallen from meditation? Does he not perish like
          a scattered cloud?” (Arjuna feels that the meditator has no puṇya,
          because he has not done any karma. He has failed to achieve liberation
          also. Thus being deceived of puṇya and mokṣa, he must face an
          unfortunate future, according to Arjuna.) Not being able to accept
          this, Arjuna surrenders to Kṛṣṇa seeking clarification (37 to 39).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa consoles Arjuna by asserting that a spiritual seeker can never
          have a bad lot (40). The very meditation is a puṇyakarma capable of
          giving heaven and later an ideal birth for the continuation of the
          spiritual pursuit. The yogabhraṣṭa (one who has fallen from the path
          of spirituality) is reborn in a cultured, prosperous family, or may
          be, even in the family of a saint (41, 42).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having got such a birth, he gets associated with the previous wisdom
          at a very early age (43). Irresistibly drawn by the past habits
          (saṃskāras), he finds his spiritual urge suddenly growing from a small
          flame to a huge conflagration (44). Committing his entire life to the
          spiritual pursuit and supported by the saṃskāras of all the previous
          lives, he effortlessly fulfills his mission in life (45).
        </p>
        <p>
          Kṛṣṇa concludes this chapter by praising the meditator in general (46)
          and praising the meditator of Kṛṣṇa–paramātmā (Brahmātman) in
          particular.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Since the main topic here is meditation, the chapter is called{" "}
