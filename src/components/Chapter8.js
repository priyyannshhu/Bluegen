          <h1>Gita Ch 08 - Akshara Brahma Yoga</h1>
          <h2>अक्षरब्रह्मयोग</h2>
          <p>Akṣara Brahma Yoga - The Imperishable Brahman</p>
          <p>
            The previous chapter concluded by introducing certain technical
            terms, and this one begins with an explanation of those. It then
            details various spiritual practices undertaken by those who desire
            to merge with the Supreme. This chapter also describes the two paths
            followed by the “jiva” after it leaves the body – one being the path
            of eventual return (to this world) and the other being the path of
            no return (krama-mukti). Below are the main themes of Chapter 8:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Verses 1 - 4:</strong> Definition of the terms Brahman,
              adhyātma, karma, adhibūta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajña.
            </li>

        <h2>Commentary by Swami Paramarthananda</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Krishna concluded the seventh chapter by glorifying the
          jñāni-bhakta as one who knows Brahman, adhyātma, karma, adhibūta, and
          adhiyajña (i.e., the complete nature of God consisting of parā and
          aparā-prakṛti). He emphasizes that remembering God at the time of
          death is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          In pursuit of clarity regarding these concepts, Arjuna poses seven
          questions to Krishna. The eighth chapter begins with these
          inquiries—the first six addressing the terms beginning with Brahman
          and the last concerning the thoughts of a person at the time of death.
        </p>

        <h3>Definition of Key Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Krishna elucidates that Brahman is the imperishable Truth, while
          Adhyātma (or ātman) refers to the same Brahman that exists behind
          individual equipment. Karma encompasses all actions that are the cause
          for the birth of all beings. Adhibhūta signifies the entire perishable
          and inert universe. Adhidaiva represents Hiraṇyagarbha, who blesses
          all the organs of all beings. Lastly, Adhiyajña is the Lord, serving
          as the presiding deity over all individual actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Remembrance at Death</h3>
        <p>
          From the fifth verse to the chapter's conclusion, Lord Krishna
          elaborates on how to remember the Lord at the time of death. The
          predominant thought pattern at the moment of death determines the
          nature and place of rebirth. Thus, if one yearns for the Lord during
          their final moments, their rebirth will be conducive to pursuing the
          Divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said that those who are saguṇa-upāsakas will reach Brahmaloka,
          where they attain liberation through knowledge from Brahmā, the
          creator himself. This phenomenon is termed krama-mukti. However, the
          thought pattern at death is shaped by one's overall mental disposition
          throughout life. Therefore, Krishna urges us to remember God
          constantly to ensure His remembrance at death.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it may seem challenging, success can be achieved through
          persistent effort and sincere practice.
        </p>

        <h3>The Practice of Upāsanā</h3>
        <p>
          From verses nine to thirteen, Krishna elaborates on the practice of
          upāsanā during death. One must control the organs of perception and
          action. Through skilled yoga practice, prāṇa should be drawn up
          through the suṣumnā-nāḍī to the head's crown, between the eyebrows.
          Then, the mind must be withdrawn back to its source, the heart. With a
          focused mind, one should meditate on oṅkāra or any chosen deity with
          devotion. This leads to God, who is omniscient, eternal, and the
          sustainer of all. All scriptures speak of Him, and all earnest seekers
          ultimately reach Him.
        </p>

        <h3>Comparison of Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Krishna compares two types of goals: the eternal God and the finite
          world. No one can escape the cycle of birth through transient
          achievements, even Brahmā, who has an extensive lifespan. All beings
          and worlds are impermanent. God is the only eternal principle, beyond
          creation, and the ultimate goal of life. Attaining Him means one does
          not take rebirth in the mortal realm.
        </p>

        <h3>The Two Paths</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter also delineates the bright path (śukla-gati) that leads to
          liberation and the dark path (Krishna-gati) that leads to rebirth. An
          upāsaka who departs through the bright path gains self-knowledge from
          Brahmā and becomes liberated. In contrast, ritualists traveling the
          dark path return after enjoying heavenly pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the bright path leads to God, it should be the sole focus.
          Krishna advises Arjuna to commit to upāsanā, emphasizing its
          superiority over all other pursuits.
        </p>

        <h3>Glory of Upāsanā</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter concludes by praising upāsanā as the most exalted means to
          attain God, superior to any other achievement. An upāsaka becomes a
          jñāni-bhakta and achieves liberation in this life. If not, they will
          still journey along the bright path to Brahmaloka, gaining knowledge
          from Brahmā before attaining liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, upāsanā is essential for both jīvanmukti (liberation in this
          life) and krama-mukti (liberation after death).
        </p>
